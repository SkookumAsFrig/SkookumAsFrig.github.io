<p>Completed as a part of MAE 2250 Mechanical Synthesis course design project. While most teams chose to design and fabricate a simple piston pump, our team chose to take on the challenge of creating the first centrifugal water pump in the courseâ€™s history (this course project has remained unchanged in the Cornell ME curriculum for a long time). We optimized the design of the impeller geometry according to a few research papers, and designed everything to be fabricated on basic manual mills and lathes with a budget constraint of $70. The frame and housing is all 6061 aluminum, while the impeller is low carbon steel. I did all of the welding on a Tungsten-Inert-Gas welder, and 3D printed the gears on my BigXY in Taulman 910 Nylon. Although the pump malfunctioned halfway into the trial due to a gear defect, it was able to satisfy the design challenge of pumping 1L of water before the unfortunate event.</p>
