I"™	<h3 id="project-description">Project Description</h3>

<p>Cigna had four web applications to facilitate sales of health and dental insurance</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Broker Portal</strong> - Agents sell policies, run quotes, and view commissions data</li>
  <li><strong>Quoting Portal</strong> - Individuals get quotes for health &amp; dental coverage</li>
  <li><strong>Enrollment Portal</strong> - Individuals enroll in health &amp; dental policies</li>
  <li><strong>Member Portal</strong> - Members view benefits, make payments, and track claims</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="contributions">Contributions</h3>
<p>My work with Cignaâ€™s portals spanned three years, driven largely by new feature requests:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Support for quoting dental products across ten states</li>
  <li>Add and terminate health products across ten states for quoting &amp; enrollment</li>
  <li>Overhaul the billing calculations and layout for members</li>
  <li>Modify PDF proposals generated with PDFlib</li>
</ul>

<p>I also created a bulk premium rating tool that allows internal rate analysts to run large data sets through uploadable spreadsheets to test their own quote rating engines.</p>

<h3 id="challenges-overcame">Challenges Overcame</h3>

<p>This period marked a lot of growth for me as a junior web developer coming from a startup company, getting my feet wet with enterprise-level web applications.</p>

<p>The biggest challenges I faced were mostly enterprise firsts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Absorb the vast business domain of health &amp; related insurance</li>
  <li>Implement DB2 cursors to facilitate server-side pagination in result sets</li>
  <li>Write design and test documents</li>
  <li>Collaborate on teams of business analysts, project managers, and QA</li>
</ul>

<p>There were also technical challenges where I was in over my head:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learn an in-house-built MVC framework, also my first MVC framework</li>
  <li>Map values to PDFs proposals using complex XMLs</li>
  <li>Work with AJAX using Prototype to call premium rating web services</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="accomplishments">Accomplishments</h3>

<p>My biggest personal accomplishment was conquering the huge learning curve of domain knowledge and enterprise exposure as a junior developer.</p>

<p>My longest lasting accomplishment is the previously-mentioned bulk premium rating tool, which is still in use today and continues to save countless hours for an entire team of rate analysts.</p>
