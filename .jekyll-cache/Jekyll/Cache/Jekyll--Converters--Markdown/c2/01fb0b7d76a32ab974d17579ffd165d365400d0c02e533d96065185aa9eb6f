I"¡<p>When it comes to keeping track of things I want to do, and things I want to remember, it seems like Iâ€™ve tried everything under the Sun.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sticky notes</li>
  <li>Text files</li>
  <li>Excel Spreadsheets</li>
  <li>Phone apps</li>
  <li>PC Software</li>
  <li>Email tagging/folders</li>
</ul>

<p>You name it, Iâ€™ve tried it. But I always seem to come back to plain text files though.</p>

<p>Excel worked decently for tracking complicated projects for work with numerous deadlines and tasks to check off.</p>

<p><a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> worked decently enough for tracking all the emails, conversations and meetings I was having for a particularly big, 4-month long project.</p>

<p>Various android apps have always worked for me, but limited me to tracking via my phone. To this day, I still catch myself leaving email marked as unread to get to them later on.</p>

<p>All of those options put my tasks &amp; lists in a proprietary format, which Iâ€™ve always hated.</p>

<p>And then along came dropbox.</p>

<p>It was dropbox that sent me back to using text files again, due to it cross-platform portability.</p>

<h3 id="tracking-lists">Tracking Lists</h3>

<p>Being a highly organized person, I tend to keep lists of things I want to get around to. Here are some of my most used:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>movies.txt</strong> - movies, by genre, I want to see eventually</li>
  <li><strong>bands.txt</strong> - bands, by genre, to check out</li>
  <li><strong>buy.txt</strong> - groceries, kayak stuff, shoes, office chairs, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>games.txt</strong> - games I want to get around to playing eventually</li>
  <li><strong>programming.txt</strong> - ever growing list of technologies to check out</li>
</ul>

<p>With dropbox, these lists are accessible from my phone, work computers (Windows), and my home computer (Linux).</p>

<h3 id="todo-tasks">Todo Tasks</h3>

<p>After coming back to text files for my todo list as well, I eventually discovered <a href="http://todotxt.com/">Todo.txt</a>.</p>

<p>Todo.txt is basically an enhanced text file that allows prioritization &amp; categorizing. There are Windows, Linux, iphone, and android apps available to work with it.</p>

<p>I mainly use this for work, to keep track of the maelstrom of tasks I have to manage. <a href="https://github.com/benrhughes/todotxt.net">Todotxt.net</a> is the amazing Windows client Iâ€™ve been using for that.</p>

<p>It allows adding, editing, deleting, and archiving of tasks, setting dates, reprioritizing and other such tasks with simple keyboard commands.</p>

<p>When marking a task as completed, it auto-archives it to  a done.txt file.</p>

<p>Todo.txt uses letters to set priorities. I donâ€™t use all 26 letters in the alphabet, just the first five with the following meanings:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>A</strong> - tasks I want to get to today</li>
  <li><strong>B</strong> - tasks I will do tomorrow</li>
  <li><strong>C</strong> - tasks I want to get to this week</li>
  <li><strong>D</strong> - tasks in the near future for next week</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> - all other tasks</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="when-i-dont-use-text-files">When I Donâ€™t Use Text Files</h3>

<p>Thereâ€™s two files I have not managed to replace with text files, because they use the calculation feature in spreadsheet programs.</p>

<p>One is a spreadsheet for auto repair tracking, with a list of repairs on the Y axis, and 3k mile intervals on the x axis. The mile intervals is what calculates automatically.</p>

<p>The other is a camping spreadsheet, which contains every camping item I own, with its weight, to make it easy to calculate base/pack/food weight when deciding what to bring camping/backpacking.</p>
