<p>The robot is an iRobot Create with an Intel Realsense RGBD camera, and the normal iRobot suite of sensors (odometry, bump, wheel drop).</p>

<p>The robot is placed in one of k possible initial positions, with arbitrary orientation. The robot is tasked with:</p>

<p>• Localizing itself</p>

<p>• Determining which of the optional walls are actually in the environment and produce an actual map</p>

<p>• Navigating to as many of the given waypoints as possible</p>

<p>• No overhead localization is provided during competition, so the robot must navigate the environment “blind”.</p>

<p>The team’s score for the competition is calculated as follows:</p>

<p>• 10 points for each correct waypoint visited</p>

<p>• 20 points for each correct ECwaypoint visited</p>

<p>• -5 points every time the robot indicates incorrectly that it is at a waypoint</p>

<p>• 10 points for each optional wall that is correctly determined (is in the workspace or not)</p>

<p>• -10 points for each optional wall that is incorrectly determined (no points are deducted for optional walls that have not been determined)</p>

<p>• 10*(time limit (minutes) - actual time(minutes)) if all waypoints and ECwaypoints are visited before time runs out</p>

<p>• up to 20 points for creative and innovative solution</p>

<p>Our team scored 80 points (90 if you count the first beacon, we did not beep for it because we thought it was obvious), which ranked 5th in the class. I was proud of this accomplishment as we were only a two person team, and completed a complex software suite for autonomous mapping and navigation that worked well under very poor computing conditions (~1.5Hz sensor updates). Project duration was 3 weeks, and</p>
