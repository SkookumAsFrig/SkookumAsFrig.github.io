<p>Small footprint SAMD21G18A MCU development board, measuring only 45x40mm. Based on Cortex M0, it is Arduino compatible with JTag ISP functionality. Completed in 24 hours, from start of schematics library to submission to manufacturer. Fabricated in 4 days with professional surface mount assembly.</p>

<p>This project was done during a holiday trip in China, as a feeler for the PCBA manufacturing pipeline there. As the results show, it was extremely efficient, as I got the boards assembled and delivered within a week of beginning the design. This gave me invaluable experience with the end-to-end process of making PCBAs, especially with tight time constraints. I am now familiar with how long each process takes, and why.</p>
