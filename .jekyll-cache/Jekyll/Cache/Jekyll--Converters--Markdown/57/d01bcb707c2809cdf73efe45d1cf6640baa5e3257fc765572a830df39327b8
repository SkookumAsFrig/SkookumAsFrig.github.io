<p>AVMA has a multi-user site for agents, students, and members that allows all three to run insurance quotes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Agent Portal</strong> - Agents sell policies, run quotes, and manage sales</li>
  <li><strong>Student Portal</strong> - Students view coverage, make payments, and get quotes</li>
  <li><strong>Member Portal</strong> - Members view coverage, make payments, and get quotes</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="contributions">Contributions</h3>

<p>My work with AVMAâ€™s portals in 2012 were driven largely by new feature requests:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Integrate Google Analyticsâ€™ conversion funnels for the quoting process</li>
  <li>Streamline the quoting process to increase usability</li>
  <li>Add new products for quoting, PDF proposal rendering, and premium rating</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="challenges-overcame">Challenges Overcame</h3>

<p>The biggest challenges I faced were with Google Analytics and AVMAâ€™s complex product offering:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Implement Google Analystics and funneling for the first time</li>
  <li>Working with complex rating, plan, and benefit structures previously unexposed to</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="accomplishments">Accomplishments</h3>

<p>The AVMA portals were the first modular applications Iâ€™ve ever worked with and really opened by eyes for application development in terms of scalability and reusability.</p>
