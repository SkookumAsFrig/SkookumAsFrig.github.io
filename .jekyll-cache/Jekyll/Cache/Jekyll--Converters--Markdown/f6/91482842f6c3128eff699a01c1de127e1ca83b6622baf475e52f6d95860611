<p>Beazley had a group enrollment platform where the companies could only enroll one employee at a time using a wizard-based flow.</p>

<p>The task on this project was to overhaul it to facilitate real-time mass-employee enrolling. We were tasked to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Allowed bulk, asynchronous adds/changes of employees and coverages</li>
  <li>Integrate into the existing Beazley Employer Portal that their groups use</li>
  <li>Ensure fast performance and real-time enrollment processing</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="contributions">Contributions</h3>

<p>I worked on a team of developers that worked directly with the business unit as well as the middleware teams who provided the real-time enrollment processing web services.</p>

<p>Some of the tasks we split up amongst ourselves were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Design interactive jQuery UI allowing adds/changes to be done on one screen</li>
  <li>Submit enrollments to a backend Java/WMB XML web service using AJAX</li>
  <li>Add real-time status tracking of new enrollments and changes</li>
</ul>

<p>On top of these design &amp; development tasks, I took on the job of predicting, organizing, and estimating every task we all had to do to ship the product.</p>

<h3 id="challenges-overcame">Challenges Overcame</h3>

<p>This project was the biggest undertaking I had to date in terms of cross-team coordination due to all the Java technology being leveraged:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>WMB</strong> - Manage queues and inter-application communications/mapping</li>
  <li><strong>Business Rules Team</strong> - Validate business rule on XML request from us</li>
  <li><strong>Java Team</strong> - Transform validated XML request into 834 flat file for Admin</li>
  <li><strong>Admin/COBOL</strong> - Issue policies &amp; changes on the mainframe</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="accomplishments">Accomplishments</h3>

<p>The greatest accomplishment of this project was that our system saves the insured companies/groups dozens of hours every enrollment period, reducing their frustration and increasing their satisfaction as Beazley customers.</p>
