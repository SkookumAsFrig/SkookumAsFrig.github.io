<p>I was a part of Cornell Resistance Racing for 2 years. We were first an electric motorcycle team, and completed our project in 2016. In 2017, we became a Shell Eco Marathon team, competing in the prototype electric category of the Americas competition. I led the vehicle body subteam, responsible for aerodynamic design and optimization. Using primarily ANSYS Fluent CFD, I was able to construct physics simulations that helped us to iteratively improve the drag characteristics. I also built and designed an electric motor dynamometer that helped us pick the most suitable drivetrain components. In our inaugural year. we stunned the competition by achieving overall 5th place at the Americas competition, electric category with an efficiency of 167.4m/kWh.</p>
