<p>Probably one of my riskier projects, it began when I bought a Tesla battery module on Ebay from a salvaged 2017 Model S that only had 3700 miles on the odometer. I bought it for no other reason than the fact that it was even cheaper than the manufacturing cost per kWh of capacity, and I now have 444 NCA chemistry Lithium-Ion cells. Then I decided to make a watercooled electric bicycle battery pack from it, since I have never seen anyone do that before. And to say that I have Tesla cells in my E-bike battery just sounds so cool. This is a project still in progress, but I have finished most of the mechanical design, just need to find time to manufacture it. Also aiming to eventually replace the off-the-shelf BMS with a custom design of my own.</p>
