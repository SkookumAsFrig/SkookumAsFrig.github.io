I"><p>“Don’t Make Me Think” is a classic book on web usability. This is what I learned from the book, reduced down to a three minute read.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Usability is how well a person of average ability and experience can figure out how to use a website to accomplish something without it being more trouble than it’s worth.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="dont-make-me-think">Don’t Make Me Think</h3>

<p>When a user looks at a web page, they should be able to get what it is, and how to use it, without expending any effort into thinking about it.</p>

<h3 id="design-for-scanning-not-reading">Design for Scanning, not Reading</h3>

<p>People don’t read web pages, they scan them.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Separate content into grid chunks</li>
  <li>Make clickable things <strong><em>look</em></strong> clickable</li>
  <li>Format text to support scanning: use headings, short paragraphs, lists</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="users-like-mindless-choices">Users Like Mindless Choices</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It doesn’t matter how many times I have to click, as long as each click is a mindless, unambiguous choice.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="omit-needless-words">Omit Needless Words</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Get rid of half the words on each page, then get rid of half of what’s left.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wording should be concise, and wisely chosen.</p>

<ul>
  <li>reduces noise level</li>
  <li>makes useful content more prominent &amp; concise</li>
  <li>allows pages to be scanned better</li>
</ul>

<p>Kill happy talk, introductory text, welcome text, and instructions.</p>

<h3 id="design-navigation-properly">Design Navigation Properly</h3>

<p>Good navigation tells the user what’s on the site, and how to use it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Always include a home link.</li>
  <li>Include breadcrumbs</li>
  <li>Highlight the navigation for the current page</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-home-page-should-spell-out-the-big-picture">The Home Page Should Spell out the Big Picture</h3>

<p>The home page should clearly and quickly answer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is this?</li>
  <li>What do they have here?</li>
  <li>What can I do here?</li>
  <li>Why should I be here and not somewhere else?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="arguments-about-usability-are-a-waste-of-time">Arguments About Usability Are a Waste of Time</h3>

<p>CEOs, programmers, designers, and business people are all are biased as to how they think a page should look. Debates on how the average user would use the site are pointless because the average user is not like us.</p>

<p>Thus, focus groups are ill-suited for optimizing the user’s experience.</p>

<p>The only solution is usability testing.</p>

<h3 id="keep-usability-testing-simple">Keep Usability Testing Simple</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>A usability test is watching one person try to use something or doing typical tasks so you can detect and fix the things that confuse and frustrate them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A test session consists of:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Welcome</strong> (4 min)</li>
  <li><strong>Questions</strong> about user to put them at ease (2 min)</li>
  <li><strong>Home page tour</strong> with user saying what they think the site does (3 min)</li>
  <li><strong>Various tasks</strong> with user verbally thinking out loud (35 min)</li>
  <li><strong>Probing questions</strong> to user as to why they did what they did (5 min)</li>
  <li><strong>Wrapping Up</strong> (5 min)</li>
</ul>

<p>Most common problems are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Users are unclear on the concept of the page or site</li>
  <li>The words they’re looking for aren’t there</li>
  <li>There’s too much going on</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Focus ruthlessly on fixing the most serious problems first.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="mobile-design">Mobile Design</h3>

<p>Responsive design is hard to do well.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Allow zooming</li>
  <li>Keep every feature available that full site has</li>
  <li>Or if not, make it easy to switch to the full site</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="users-goodwill-reservoir">User’s Goodwill Reservoir</h3>

<p>The user’s reservoir of goodwill lasts only so long before they leave.</p>

<p>Make the main things that people want to do on your site obvious and easy, lest you piss them off and deplete their reservoir.</p>

<h3 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h3>

<p>Test your site out with a screen reader to see how usable it is.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use headings correctly</li>
  <li>Add alt text to every image</li>
  <li>Use labels on forms</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sell-usability-at-work">Sell Usability at Work</h3>

<p>Screw ROI &amp; sales language, instead, get your boss and stakeholders to watch a live usability test.</p>
