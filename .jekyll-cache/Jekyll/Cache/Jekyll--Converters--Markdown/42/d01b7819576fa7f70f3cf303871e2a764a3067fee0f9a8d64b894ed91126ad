<p>An in-house-built, pre-existing payment portal tokenizes and processes payments for various healh insurance carriers selling coverage on the Heathcare.gov ‚ÄúFederal Marketplace‚Äù.</p>

<p>A good half of the states under the Affordable Healthcare Act have elected to run their own <a href="http://kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/state-health-insurance-marketplace-types/">state-based marketplaces</a> instead.</p>

<p>The payment portal was initially designed around the strict standards of that Federal Marketplace, which state-based marketplaces do not have to follow.</p>

<p>To scale the payment portal to any number of state-based marketplaces, it had to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Accept any request type, not just Healthcare.gov-formatted SAML XML</li>
  <li>Configure client-specific features and customizations</li>
  <li>Send any response type, not just Healthcare.gov-formatted POST response</li>
  <li>Support any type of request-level security, eg:
    <ul>
      <li>Restful POST request tokens</li>
      <li>Signed SAML</li>
      <li>SOAP encryption</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="contributions">Contributions</h3>

<p>This project consisted of two senior developers: myself, and another who was in charge of a different state marketplace.</p>

<p>Together, we crafted the solutions that allowed this payment portal to scale to any number of state marketplaces.</p>

<p>We wrapped the application with configurable pre and post processors, which were in charge of the request/response handling, security, and application-level configurations.</p>

<p>Test harnesses were also created to simulate the state marketplaces where the users would be coming from to submit payments.</p>

<h3 id="challenges-overcame">Challenges Overcame</h3>

<p>This project was a tidal wave of advanced concepts and technologies that I have only been previously exposed to minimally.</p>

<p>I have to seriously step my game up in the areas of cryptography, SOAP web services, and SAML processing, and learned a lot of new tools in the process.</p>

<h3 id="accomplishments">Accomplishments</h3>

<p>The payment portal was already highly successful, processing payments in the federal marketplace, which is roughly half of the states in the U.S.</p>

<p>By upgrading this application to flexibly scale to any number of state-based marketplaces, Healthplan Services is able to tap into the markets of the other half of the U.S, which all have state-based marketplaces of some kind.</p>
