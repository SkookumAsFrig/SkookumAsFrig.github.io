I"}<h3 id="project-description">Project Description</h3>

<p>I was a part of Cornell Racing from freshman to senior year of college. Was a member of unsprung, suspension and lastly a member of the EE team. Worked on compliance testing, A-arm suspension design, monocoque manufacturing, and various other parts of the project. In my last year, we switched to an electric racecar for the first time in the team’s history, and I worked on designing the DC/DC converter.</p>

<p>The team consists of a group of undergraduate students dedicated to building a new and better racecar every year, to compete in the Formula SAE competitions around North America. The team has over 30 years of history, and for the past decade it has been building a fully custom carbon fiber monocoque which is quite unique to a student team.</p>

<p>Some specifications for ARG18, the car from 2018:</p>

<p><b>Suspension &amp; Unsprung</b></p>

<p>• 4-wheel independent double A-arm suspension
• Pushrod-actuated Penske 7800 2-way adjustable dampers
• 7.5x10” Hoosier R25B Racing Slicks
• Adjustable front and rear anti-roll system
• Custom Aluminum uprights, hubs, and wheel centers</p>

<p><b>Electronics</b></p>

<p>• MoTeC M400 EC
• MoTeC ADL3 Data Logger
• Modular CAN Data Acquisition
• Launch and traction control</p>

<p><b>Powertrain</b></p>

<p>• Turbocharged 4-Cylinder Honda CBR600RR engine
• BorgWarner KP-35 Turbocharger with Custom DMLS Turbine Housing
• Custom Dry Sump Lubrication System
• Chain-driven Drexler Mechanical LSD</p>

<p>This combined produces a 100-hp, single-seater that does 0-60mph in about 2 seconds, pulls 2.5 g’s in corners, and weighs in at just over 400lbs. Some results:</p>

<p>• ARG17, 8th place finish at Michigan 2017, 5th place design finalist (125 teams)
• ARG18, 12th place finish at Michigan 2018 (114 teams)</p>
