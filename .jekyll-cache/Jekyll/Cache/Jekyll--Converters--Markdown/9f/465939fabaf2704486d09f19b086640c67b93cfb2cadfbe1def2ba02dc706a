<p>Inspired by BJ Baldwinâ€™s <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bj+baldwin+trophy+truck&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwlKKaoIffAhVGiqwKHd-yA4gQ_AUIDigB&amp;biw=1270&amp;bih=951" style="color: #a83232" target="_blank">Monster Energy Trophy Truck</a>, I decided to attempt to create my own in RC car form. There have been a few successful examples done by enthusiasts in the RC community such as <a href="https://www.rccaraction.com/rc-scratch-built-completely-custom-totally-tubular-justin-hiltons-nsp-1/#outer-popup" style="color: #a83232" target="_blank">this</a>. However, there are no solid axle trucks powered by a nitro engine. So I have set out to do just that, and created a custom roll cage matched to the original as much as possible, along with realistic wire actuated disc brakes. However, I just do not have the time and resources to devote to finishing a project like this right now. So this has been temporarily shelved until I get access to a welder again. Learned a ton about frame design tools along the way though.</p>
