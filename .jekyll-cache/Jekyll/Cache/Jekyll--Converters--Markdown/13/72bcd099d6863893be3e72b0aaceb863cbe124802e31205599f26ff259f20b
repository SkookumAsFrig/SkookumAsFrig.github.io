<p>One of the crazier ideas of mine, I decided to create the printer that is designed to print printers. Project began in freshman year of college as I was extremely bored by school, and finished in that summer. With a build volume of 470x510x510mm and full metal frame and extruder, BigXY can run all filaments on the market, while achieving good production accuracy. Dual ballscrew Z axis to support the heated glass build plate, and a beefy Nema 21 stepper to drive it. Linear rail X and Y axis, powered by 2 60mm Nema 17â€™s running CoreXY mechanism with a direct drive E3D style extruder. The XY belt is stainless reinforced polyurethane to minimize stretch. Involved a lot of machining and a decent amount of welding to build, but only costed around $700 including electronics.</p>

<p>This project was done on a tight timeline of 4 weeks. There were many functionalities that had to be built from the ground up, such as motion control, face tracking, and interactive behavior. This was made more difficult by the fact that the computation was heavily restricted to a Raspberry Pi. Our development process consisted of building each modular function separately and tested in an isolated routine, then integrating the functionalities one-by-one. In the end, we built a multi-threaded python application, structured like an operating system to simultaneously handle multiple external signals. In terms of hardware, it was all custom built, and thankfully most of the robot arm was available from another ongoing project. However, it still required some design ingenuity to package the components elegantly, and for the entire module to come together as an interactive display. The website that we built to summarize the project in report form can be found <a href="https://courses.ece.cornell.edu/ece5990/ECE5725_Fall2019_Projects/Dec_04_Demo/Pixar_Lamp/Website/index.html#" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
