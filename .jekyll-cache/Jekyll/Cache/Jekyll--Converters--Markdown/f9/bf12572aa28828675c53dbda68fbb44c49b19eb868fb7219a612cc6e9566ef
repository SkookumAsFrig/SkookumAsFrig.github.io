I"–<h3 id="project-description">Project Description</h3>

<p>I was a part of Cornell Racing from freshman to senior year of college. Was a member of unsprung, suspension and lastly a member of the EE subteam. Worked on compliance testing, A-arm suspension design, monocoque manufacturing, and various other parts of the project. This year, we are switching to an electric racecar for the first time in the team‚Äôs history, so I am designing the DC/DC converter.</p>

<p>We are a team of undergraduate students dedicated to building a new and better racecar every year, to compete in the Formula SAE competitions around North America. The team has over 30 years of history, and for the past decade we have been building a fully custom carbon fiber monocoque which is quite unique to a student team. Some specifications for ARG18, our car from last year:</p>

<p>Suspension &amp; Unsprung</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ 4-wheel independent double A-arm suspension
‚Ä¢ Pushrod-actuated Penske 7800 2-way adjustable dampers
‚Ä¢ 7.5x10‚Äù Hoosier R25B Racing Slicks
‚Ä¢ Adjustable front and rear anti-roll system
‚Ä¢ Custom Aluminum uprights, hubs, and wheel centers</p>

<p>Electronics</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ MoTeC M400 EC
‚Ä¢ MoTeC ADL3 Data Logger
‚Ä¢ Modular CAN Data Acquisition
‚Ä¢ Launch and traction control</p>

<p>Powertrain</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Turbocharged 4-Cylinder Honda CBR600RR engine
‚Ä¢ BorgWarner KP-35 Turbocharger with Custom DMLS Turbine Housing
‚Ä¢ Custom Dry Sump Lubrication System
‚Ä¢ Chain-driven Drexler Mechanical LSD</p>

<p>This combined produces a 100-hp, single-seater that does 0-60mph in about 2 seconds, pulls 2.5 g‚Äôs in corners, and weighs in at just over 400lbs. Some results:</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ ARG17, 8th place finish at Michigan 2017, 5th place design finalist (125 teams)
‚Ä¢ ARG18, 12th place finish at Michigan 2018 (114 teams)</p>

<h3 id="challenges-and-accomplishments">Challenges and Accomplishments</h3>

<p>This project was done on a tight timeline of 4 weeks. There were many functionalities that had to be built from the ground up, such as motion control, face tracking, and interactive behavior. This was made more difficult by the fact that the computation was heavily restricted to a Raspberry Pi. Our development process consisted of building each modular function separately and tested in an isolated routine, then integrating the functionalities one-by-one. In the end, we built a multi-threaded python application, structured like an operating system to simultaneously handle multiple external signals. In terms of hardware, it was all custom built, and thankfully most of the robot arm was available from another ongoing project. However, it still required some design ingenuity to package the components elegantly, and for the entire module to come together as an interactive display. The website that we built to summarize the project in report form can be found <a href="https://courses.ece.cornell.edu/ece5990/ECE5725_Fall2019_Projects/Dec_04_Demo/Pixar_Lamp/Website/index.html#" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
