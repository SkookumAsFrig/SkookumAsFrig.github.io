I"K<p>Warren Buffett has often been quoted to say that the most powerful factor in his financial success is “compounding interest”. I feel the same way, not just about long-term investments but also in the accumulation of knowledge, especially through reading books.</p>

<p>Ironically, for the longest time I have taken the opposite stance, and not without good reason. I practically have never read a book not required by some course or exam, and have done fine in my academic career. If there was something I wanted to learn, online courses and Youtube videos did the job. That is, until the tail end of my studies and I realized how much was missing in my understanding of the world, a gap that only the investment of time could make up. In particular, I wanted to master personal finance, and not just to the degree of your average Robinhood gambler, or to pass an artificial test. I wanted to truly succeed in that subject with minimal missteps, because my competence would have a direct impact on my future. Unlike the countless exams I have taken to arrive at this point, there is no “fair” assessment that can be finessed through simple tricks. The only assessment is one’s wealth and to a degree one’s happiness, a cost too dear for me to pay. As my frantic online searches only brought up more questions than they answered, I realized I had to change my attitude towards learning. To systematically excel in such a historied and multivariate topic as money management, I needed new tools.</p>

<p>As the return on investment compounds to generate a larger gain the following year, the knowledge base obtained from reading rewards with a more profound understanding of future learnings. Moreover, the focused deep dives offer a greater opportunity of knowledge retention, compared against the ad hoc learning of Google searches and Youtube videos. I was also heavily influenced by my mother, who reads abundantly. Her biggest regret was not starting sooner, echoing the many investment advices I read online, and though I have heard her counsel many times before, this is the first time I listened. Thus, I have set a realistic goal for myself, to read 10 books this year. It is now August 2020, and I have read the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>money walks 会走路的钱</strong> - It starts you with a CLI-only bedrock OS, a foundation which to build ones dreams on top of. There’s no extra fluff, not even beloved <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/locate">locate</a>!</li>
  <li><strong>Sculptable</strong> - I choose the desktop environment, everything is compatible. I choose how to administer it. I choose what software goes on it. I choose everything.</li>
  <li><strong>Bleeding Edge</strong> - This whole rolling release thing is dreamy. As a former Debian/Ubuntu/Mint user, I was occasionally running into problems just to find out my packages were out of date, even freshly installed ones. It wasn’t until Arch that I experienced the famed rolling release model, as popularized by Fedora.</li>
  <li><strong>Teachy</strong> - Arch is an educator. Since it doesn’t hold your hand and magically obscure everything from you, you actually get a clue of what’s going on under the hood. Using Arch is like living in a spoken language’s native country. I thought this quality would be tedious, but it has turned out to be enjoyable and informative.</li>
