I"’<h3 id="project-description">Project Description</h3>

<p>I was a part of Cornell Racing from freshman to senior year of college. Was a member of unsprung, suspension and lastly a member of the EE team. Worked on compliance testing, A-arm suspension design, monocoque manufacturing, and various other parts of the project. In my last year, we switched to an electric racecar for the first time in the team‚Äôs history, and I worked on designing the DC/DC converter.</p>

<p>The team consists of a group of undergraduate students dedicated to building a new and better racecar every year, to compete in the Formula SAE competitions around North America. The team has over 30 years of history, and for the past decade it has been building a fully custom carbon fiber monocoque which is quite unique to a student team.</p>
