### Project Description

A phone case that fits the Iphone 6 Plus, with unique mechanisms on the back, turn key CW to lock, CCW to unlock.

### Challenges and Accomplishments

Developed for Open Design Project, as a part of MAE 2250 course at Cornell University where it won the Outstanding Design Project award.

The challenge was to design a study aid based on user-needs interview with students, and this is our findings:

The user has extensive, sometimes even excessive interaction with electronic devices, particularly the phone, and is often distracted by it. We decided to create a device that would reduce that distracting interaction. This will promote successful and worthwhile studying to ensure the student’s success in his/her final exams. The design we came up with is a phone case which can be locked with multiple mechanisms, and has a fidgeting “toy” to help direct the user away from the device inside.

Use 1.75mm filament as hinge pins, and glue the flange/gear pins onto the case. 9X 8mm M3 socket cap screws and 1X 2.5mm hex key are needed for assembly. 2.5mm hex key also acts as the key to the lock.
