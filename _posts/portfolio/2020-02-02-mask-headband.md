### Project Description

When Covid19 first hit the US, a group of makers including myself at Cornell were asked to pool our rapid prototyping resources and 3D print face shield visors for Cornell's Weill Medical Center in NYC, which expanded to a few other surrounding hospitals. The effort was organized by a group of professors, students and community volunteers, and helped alleviate the emergency PPE shortage. This was ultimately solved through a injection molded design that we developed.

### Challenges and Accomplishments

We first began 3D printing as many of the visor bands as possible. The design was an <a href="https://3dprint.nih.gov/discover/3dpx-013306" style="color: #a83232" target="_blank">open source one by 3DVerkstan</a>. It consisted of a single printable head band, which could be easily assembled with a letter sized laminate sheet using a 3 hole punch. In total, we printed over 10,000 visor bands and organized the delivery to NYC hospitals in need. During this initiative, I and a few others (Mark Brancale, Jiaohao Zhang, Nils Napp) proposed a better way of manufacturing these parts with injection molding, and spun up a <a href="https://github.com/SkookumAsFrig/Cornell_PPE_InjectionMolding" style="color: #a83232" target="_blank">mass-manufacturable design</a> in a few days. The design was injection molded at Protolabs with medical grade polypropylene, at a rate of 9,000 units per day and completely satisfied the hospitals' demand.

The injection molded design had to be rebuilt from the ground up due to differences in material stiffness. FEA simulation was used to ensure similar retention force to the original 3D printed design, and DFM resulted in some design tweaks to ensure thermal stability through reducing material thickness disparities. Lastly, the material choice was important, as the visors required frequent sterilization through alcohol and UV light, so medical grade PP was selected for its heat deflection temperature and chemical resistance.
