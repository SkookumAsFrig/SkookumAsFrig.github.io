### Project Description

This was a part of the continued improvement process for my BigXY 3D printer. As with all FDM printers, thermal management can make a huge difference to the finish and tolerance of the finished part. Originally I just had an axial fan blowing from one side of the extruder, but with thin and tall parts, this skewed the part towards the cooled side due to the thermal stress differential. So I designed a 360 surround cooling fan duct, which worked fabulously although I did not know how to do CFD analysis at the time. Now that I had a dedicated simulation workstation, I decided to verify numerically the observed empirical results. The inlet velocity was chosen to be 8m/s from the fan’s flow rate specification, and a laminar inlet profile was assumed (which is obviously an ideal assumption). The realizable k-e model was used in Fluent CFD, and the post-processed results indeed show a well distributed airflow from particle tracking, with a velocity concentration right in the region of where the nozzle would have just finished laying down melted filament. This was very similar to my original design intent as shown below.
