### Project Description

The robot is an iRobot Create with an Intel Realsense RGBD camera, and the normal iRobot suite of sensors (odometry, bump, wheel drop).

The robot is placed in one of k possible initial positions, with arbitrary orientation. The robot is tasked with:

• Localizing itself

• Determining which of the optional walls are actually in the environment and produce an actual map

• Navigating to as many of the given waypoints as possible

• No overhead localization is provided during competition, so the robot must navigate the environment "blind".

The team's score for the competition is calculated as follows:

• 10 points for each correct waypoint visited

• 20 points for each correct ECwaypoint visited

• -5 points every time the robot indicates incorrectly that it is at a waypoint

• 10 points for each optional wall that is correctly determined (is in the workspace or not)

• -10 points for each optional wall that is incorrectly determined (no points are deducted for optional walls that have not been determined)

• 10*(time limit (minutes) - actual time(minutes)) if all waypoints and ECwaypoints are visited before time runs out

• up to 20 points for creative and innovative solution


### Challenges and Accomplishments

Our team scored 80 points (90 if you count the first beacon, we did not beep for it because we thought it was obvious), which ranked 5th in the class. I was proud of this accomplishment as we were only a two person team, and completed a complex software suite for autonomous mapping and navigation that worked well under very poor computing conditions (~1.5Hz sensor updates). Project duration was 2.5 weeks, and gave me invaluable hands-on experience with integrating a number of robotics algorithms into a single "operating system".
