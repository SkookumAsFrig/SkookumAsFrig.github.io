### Project Description

Completed as a part of MAE 2250 Mechanical Synthesis course design project. While most teams chose to design and fabricate a simple piston pump, our team chose to take on the challenge of creating the first centrifugal water pump in the course’s history (this course project has remained unchanged in the Cornell ME curriculum for a long time). We optimized the design of the impeller geometry according to a few research papers, and designed everything to be fabricated on basic manual mills and lathes with a budget constraint of $70. The frame and housing is all 6061 aluminum, while the impeller is low carbon steel. I did all of the welding on a Tungsten-Inert-Gas welder, and 3D printed the gears on my BigXY in Taulman 910 Nylon. Although the pump malfunctioned halfway into the trial due to a gear defect, it was able to satisfy the design challenge of pumping 1L of water before the unfortunate event.
