### Project Description

Small scale electric motor dynamometer developed for the Resistance Racing Shell Eco Marathon team and presented as the ECE 4760 Microcontrollers course final project. Based on the PIC32 MCU platform, with mostly custom designed and machined components. Goal of the project is to test the viability of producing an efficiency map similar to this one (from ANSYS, Inc.), giving a parametric evaluation of the motor performance and efficiency across a broad range of operating conditions. Basic theory is to measure RPM at various torque loads applied through a novel servo actuated brake mechanism, and derive mechanical power from that. The torque is measured through the elastic deformation of a thin 3003 aluminum tube, by reading a pair of strain gages mounted on its surface. The electrical power is measured via the ADC and a hall-effect current sensor.

### Challenges and Accomplishments

The whole project was brainstormed, designed and built in a span of 4 weeks, and was featured on popular makers’ blog Hackaday. I worked with two others for the electrical and programming aspects, and a number of team members assisted in mechanical fabrication. A big challenge was the mechanical and electrical integration, as well as the implementation of the complex functionalities we designed. Overall we were able to achieve a great proof of concept.
