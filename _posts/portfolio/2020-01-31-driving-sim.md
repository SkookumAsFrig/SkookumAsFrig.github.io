### Project Description

Building a custom racing simulator has been a long term dream of mine. I have been slowly collecting parts for it over the years; the (knockoff Bride LOW MAX) bucket seat I brought back from a trip to China, Logitech G29 I have had since college. I finally had access to the tools and space make it happen, and built this in 3 weekends.

### Challenges and Accomplishments

Ergonomics was a difficult problem to solve. I did not want this project to turn into a design exercise in CAD, that would be too time consuming and not fun tweaking and tuning (speaking from experience in the FSAE team). Instead I built the seat mount first with the monitor on a beefy arm mounted to 8020 for maximum adjustability. I was using 8020 leftover scrap from work, so made the frame as material efficient as possible with a central member expanding horizontally at both ends. To test steering ergo with pedal box distance, I fabricated a slidable pedal mount from a scrapped aluminum sheet metal bracket, then mounted the wheel on a plastic desk. I propped up the table to get it to the appropriate z-height, and moved it along the y-axis until it was in a good driving position, shown in the first image below.

After a brief user test (the wheel feedback would move the table all over the place), I mocked up the custom steel frame using these dimensions. I chose to weld a custom frame due to the high forward leaning angle I wanted the "dash" to have similar to a real car, so that getting in and out would be easy. It would be quite difficult to build stiff 45 degree frames with 8020 without custom brackets, and the orthogonal 8020 racing sims such as <a href="https://8020.net/diy2202-k1.html" style="color: #a83232" target="_blank">this one</a> require the user to do some gymnastics to extricate themselves. Also, I wanted to build in adjustability for different heights and y-axis distances for others to enjoy as well.

The result was a 2 part steel frame that has ~12in adjustability in the 45 degree axis, and able to slide the entire length of the center rail. With a small reinforcement rod tieing it to the shifter column, the structure sees minimal deflection under max service loads (i.e. lock-to-lock steering in rally games).

The final product has longitudinal and kick angle adjustability in the pedal box, 2 axis adjustability for the steering wheel, a rally/drift style handbrake, Thrustmaster TH8A gated manual/sequential shifter, and Logitech G29 wheel/pedals. I built the structure without any CAD, which was a good exercise for ergonomic mockups.
