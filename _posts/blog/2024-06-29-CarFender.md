This week we swapped out the driver side fender that was previously damaged, with a good one that we purchased in Sacramento.

To begin the install, we pulled off one corner of the bumper, the headlight bottom trim, and the headlight itself. The fender liner just needs to be unscrewed and detached in the wheel well. It is not necessary to remove these parts completely, the fender can be removed with them just loose. A good guide is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gkAGJtXxQY" target="_blank"> this video</a>, but as noted before he disassembles a bit more than needed.

Then swap over the trim piece and side marker light, and install the replacement fender with the same screws. Make them all snug but the fender still movable, close the hood to check alignment, and tighten down when it looks good. Make sure to remember to reconnect the marker light connector!
