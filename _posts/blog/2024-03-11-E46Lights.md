This was a fun little weekend project, decided to restore the headlights of me and my friend's 2004 E46 325ci using the famous Chris Fix method, linked <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEJbKLZ7RmM" style="color: #a83232" target="_blank">here</a>. The headlights were yellowed and foggy from 20 years of sun exposure and 230k miles. The materials I used:

* 600 & 3000 grit sand paper
* Walmart water spray can
* USC SprayMax 2K Glamour High Gloss Aerosol Clear Coat

Different than the video, I went to 3000 grit directly after 600, since that was what I had available. Instead of using a one part clear coat, I used a two part one that I was already spraying for some body paint repairs, which should be more durable. Note that this one is much more toxic than normal spray cans, so be sure to use an organic vapor respirator. I sanded the fog lights too, but ran out of clear coat after the body so will do that another time. The results turned out well, the last picture shows a clamp as I was epoxying up the bumper to its bracket (clip was gone). Took about half a day's work.
